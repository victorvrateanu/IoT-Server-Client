# IoT-Server-Client

Client-Server software that uses a Raspberry Pi 3 as a server. 
The server collects data from sensors and sends the encrypted data through the communication port used for connecting
the client and server. When the data is received by the client, it will dynamically save the data in a MySQL Database and
create a website using HTML and PHP where the client can see and send commands to the server. Also, the server uses
facial recognition and sends emails containing photos and data to security when someone who has no access to the
room enters through the door.
